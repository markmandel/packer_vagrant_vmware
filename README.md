Packer + Vagrant + VMWare
=========================

My [Packer](http://www.packer.io/) scripts for creating a [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com) [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) box for [Ubuntu Server](http://www.ubuntu.com/server).

This includes the path for VMWare Tools for Kernels 3.8+, so in theory it should work on any version of Ubuntu that includes it (e.g. 13.04).

Various pieces stolen from around the web. Credits are inline in files.
